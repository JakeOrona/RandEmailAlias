Mac users may receive warning when opening app for first time. This app is not signed with a developer certificate. I built the app using py2app. You may need to right click on application -> open. A warning error will display. Click ok to close warning. Right click on app again -> open. Receive a warning label again, this time clicking ok should proceed into app. This should clear the warning. You will need to repeat this if you move the application or if you download a new version. (Im not paying apple yet. When I get to swift, I get to swift).

Windows users may need to run as administrator.

If you wish to run from source:

Download the .py from master branch for latest stable code. You may adjust your PATH to include Python 3 and the .py file location.

Required Python 3 Libraries:

To run, download the source .py and use terminal to launch the python program with the following command (you may need to move the file to correct directory/change directory/adjust your PATH to include Python 3 and the file location. (Google is your friend or ask me for help):
